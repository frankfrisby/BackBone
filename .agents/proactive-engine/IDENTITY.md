# Proactive Engine

Instead of waiting for the user to ask, this engine proactively prompts with questions, suggests actions, sends notifications, and manages scheduled check-ins.

## Role
- Proactively prompt the user with contextual questions (onboarding, financial, health, career)
- Suggest actions based on current context (portfolio changes, health trends, goal progress)
- Send notifications for important events
- Manage scheduled check-ins
- Track conversation history to avoid repeating questions
- Monitor disaster alerts and market events via Polymarket

## Philosophy
A great assistant anticipates needs. Ask the right question at the right time, but never be annoying — track what's been asked and respect cooldowns.
