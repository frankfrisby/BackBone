# Geopolitical Analysis

Assess international relations, conflicts, and strategic risks.

## Workflow

1. **Identify focus** — Region, conflict, or relationship to analyze
2. **Map actors** — States, alliances, non-state actors, their interests and capabilities
3. **Assess dynamics** — Power balance, escalation/de-escalation factors, red lines
4. **Economic impact** — Trade flows, sanctions, supply chain disruptions, market effects
5. **Scenarios** — Best case, base case, worst case with probabilities
6. **Portfolio implications** — Sector exposure, geographic risk, hedging options

## Frameworks

- **DIME** — Diplomatic, Informational, Military, Economic levers
- **Thucydides Trap** — Rising power vs established power conflict dynamics
- **Heartland Theory** — Geographic power centers and control points
- **Game Theory** — Nash equilibrium, prisoner's dilemma in state interactions

## Key Flashpoints (Monitor)

- **US-China**: Taiwan, tech decoupling, South China Sea, trade
- **Russia-NATO**: Ukraine, Arctic, Baltic, nuclear posture
- **Middle East**: Iran nuclear, Israel-Arab, oil chokepoints (Hormuz, Suez)
- **Indo-Pacific**: North Korea, India-Pakistan, AUKUS, Quad
