I need you to evaluate these stocks to determine if they are working. You need to run each one without stopping. don't ask me to do anything. you have full permissions.  you can run on your own. do each task non-stop. do a commit and git push when done after each task.

1. It keeps saying claude code wants to authenticate. it say its' installed but the the backbone engine saying it needs to authenticate. i have already authenticated on the computer. Not sure why it's asking that.

2. I don't see a lot of things. such as why isn't the tickers to update with updated calcuations are you using real time data to help dtermin if astocks are changing through the courese of the day. how are the calculations, done. i should see at the end of the top section in mini. i should see green, red, pulsing gray to let me know that state of the stock market calculations.

3. I need you you to add a command for goals reset, etc. we have a git push for this yet i don't see this functioning please make sure to add this.

4. I need you to start building a package. This package is we run a script that will build the code the code and then generate a production level app where the user can install on their machine and it has a icon from the logo, it's on the machine, it's efficient, running cron jobs etc. You need to create a process where the developer can build. each build users the version 0.0.x.[git count] 
where x is a number that increments for each build
